\begin{frame}{B: Pretty Boxed Theorems}
	Below is an example of a boxed theorem environment.
	
	\begin{theorem}[additional text]
		Let $A$ and $B$ be $ n\times n $ matrices of real numbers. If $ A $ and $ B $ are both invertible, then the matrix $ AB $ is invertible.
	\end{theorem}

\begin{frame}{C1: Tikz Elements (Add Overlayed Arrows!)}
	Below is an example of using tikz to create arrows for pointing at things on the frame.
	
	\vspace{0.65\paperheight} % Creating space between above and below text.
	
	Keep in mind this method ignores whatever is on the slide, so you may need to add invisible space so that text accommodates.
