\section*{A: Layout and Structure}
	
	\subsection*{lipsum}
	Dummy text can be inserted using the lipsum package. 
	This pacakge is not dynamic rather it simply includes a whole bunch of predetermined text.
	For example the command \verb|\\lipsum[2-3]| will add paragraphs 2 through 3:
	
	\lipsum[2-3]
	
\section*{B: Math and Theorems}
	
	\subsection*{Theorem Environments}
	Examples of the plain style theorem environments where the titles are bold and the body text is printed in italics:
	\begin{assumption}
		The $ n\times n $ matrix $ X $ is invertible.
	\end{assumption}
	\begin{assumption}
		The $ n\times n $ matrix $ Y $ is invertible.
	\end{assumption}
	\begin{lemma}
		If A1 holds, then you get this somewhat obvious result which is helpful for future theorems.
	\end{lemma}
	\begin{theorem}[Amazing Result]
		If A1 and A2 hold, then something amazing follows.
	\end{theorem}

	\noindent Examples of the remark style environments where the titles are italic and the body text is regular roman:
	\begin{remark}
		This is just an aside that is minor, but worth mentioning.
	\end{remark}

	\noindent Finally we have examples of the definition style environments where the titles are bold and the body text is regular roman:
	\begin{definition}
		Here we define the variable $ p_i(z) $.
	\end{definition}
	\begin{example}
		A very specific example of the above definition, or of a model that was defined earlier could be described here.
		This can make definitions much more concrete and easier to understand.
	\end{example}
